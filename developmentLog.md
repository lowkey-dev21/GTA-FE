## Development Log: Authentication System

  **Initial Setup**
- **Project Initialization**:
  - Created the foundational structure for the authentication system, including file organization for `auth`, `login`, `sign-up`, and `email verification` modules.
  - Configured basic routing and ensured seamless navigation between authentication-related pages.

- **UI/UX Framework**:
  - Integrated essential styling libraries, ensuring responsiveness and consistency in design across devices.



### **Header Development**
1. **Header Responsiveness**:
   - Designed and implemented a responsive header layout.
   - Tested responsiveness across various screen sizes and devices, ensuring compatibility with both desktop and mobile views.

2. **Header Authentication Handling**:
   - Added functionality to reflect user authentication state in the header.
   - Included conditional rendering for login/logout buttons and user-specific elements (e.g., profile avatar or name).



### **Authentication Modules**
  **Login System**
1. **Login Bug Resolution**:
   - Diagnosed and resolved key bugs affecting the login functionality.
   - Fixed issues with input validation, error handling, and API integration.
   - Enhanced user feedback with proper error messages for incorrect credentials or network failures.

2. **Testing**:
   - Conducted end-to-end tests for successful login flows and edge cases (e.g., invalid input, server errors).

  **Sign-Up System**
1. **Sign-Up Implementation**:
   - Developed a fully functional sign-up flow with input validation.
   - Included client-side validations (e.g., password strength, email format) and server-side error handling.
   - Integrated API endpoints for creating user accounts, ensuring data security and compliance.

2. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Improved the user experience with real-time feedback on form inputs (e.g., email availability, password strength).



  **Email Verification**
1. **Verification Input**:
   - Created a 6-digit verification code input with enhanced user interactions (e.g., auto-focus on the next field, paste support for full code).
   - Designed user-friendly error messages for invalid or expired codes.

2. **Verification API Integration**:
   - Integrated API calls to verify user-provided codes.
   - Ensured proper error handling for scenarios like incorrect codes or network issues.

3. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Verified functionality for edge cases such as incomplete codes, multiple verification attempts, and API timeouts.
